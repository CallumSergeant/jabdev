    description: The JABchem Marking Schemes on this website contain data on the percentage of candidates who were correct in each the multiple choice questions. The data was taken from these sheets which also contain the percentage of candidates who also went for each wrong answer. The SQA have decided that after nearly 30 years of releasing this data on Multiple Choice Answers that they will no longer release this information from 2018 onwards.
    caption: If you have any of the multiple choice data sheets pre-2000 that I am missing please get in contact.
